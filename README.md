Personal Portfolio 

Description
The motivation for this project was to show off my skills to potential employers.

I built this project to show case my skills in HTML and CSS while showing a cohesive portfolio.

This project shows off my skills and examples of my work to companies.

I learned a lot about HTML and CSS. Also other components like containers, divs, and responsive layout.
